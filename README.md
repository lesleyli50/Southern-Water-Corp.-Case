Souther Water Corp. is an Israeli water desalination company, who suffered a lot from highe maintenance costs due to desalination pumps failing. The Engineering Team needs a data analyst to create alarm for them that is able to detect pump failure. The raw dataset on hand is minute by minute time-series data, which means the data will be recorded every minute for a number of variables like temperature, pump power and volumetric flow. In order to get better understanding of the data, we need to transform the data into 30 minutes standard deviation, and see which dataset makes more sense for our analysis.
It's also important to understand the business meaning for our analysis. Firstly, if Southern Water Corp can proactively identify pumps performing abnormally, they will likely be able to reduce their maintenance costs. More importantly, having an alert in place will save the engineers time. This means they can let the system analyze failures on their behalf as opposed to them always looking at the signal(s) themselves. If they are able to do this reliably, SWC can reduce the overall production costs and improve the overall market economics which will become a business advantage.
To sum up, the goal of the project is to conduct statistical analysis by Python to detect the trends/behavior of the pump failure, the correlations between variables and forecast failure events, so that SWC can take proactive approach for the failures and reduce maintenance costs.
